# C++

Ok I am aware this GitHub is appearing quite messy now with everything from Python and Rust, to 
CSS/Html and now also C++. As a matter of fact I started school "Programming", here in Norway, 
and we get thrown into some C++ really early. Very basic stuff, but I still need to grasp it.

I'll throw up this repo for small school stuff, but this will probably not be my "main" language. Still
consider Pyton and Rust the way to go for me. But who knows :D
