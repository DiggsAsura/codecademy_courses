// 1. Introduction to JavaScript
// 4. Arithmetic Operators

/* 
Basic arithmetic often comes in handy when programming. 

An operator is a character that performs a task in our code. JavaScript has several built-in arithmetic operators,
that allow us to perform mathematical calculations on numbers. These include the following operators and their
corresponding symbols:

1. Add: +
2. Subtract: -
3. Multiply: *
4. Divide: /
5. Remainder (modulo): %

Tasks. 
1. Inside of a console.log(), add 3.5 to your age
	 This is the age you'll be when we start sending people to live on Mars

2. On a new line write another console.log(). Inside the parantheses, take the current year and subtract 1969.
	 The answer is how many years it's been since the 1969 moon landing.
	 
3. Create another console.log(). Inside the parantheses divide 65 by 240.
	 
4. Create another console.log(). Inside the parantheses, multiply 0.2708 by 100.
	 That's the percent of the sun that is made up of helium. Assuming we could stand on the sun,
	 we'd all sound like chipmunks!
*/

console.log(37 + 3.5);
console.log(2022 - 1969);
console.log(65 / 240);
console.log(0.2708 * 100);
