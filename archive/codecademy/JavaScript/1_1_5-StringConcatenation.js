Tasks:
1. Inside a console.log() statement, concatenate the two strings 'Hello' and 'World'.
	 Note: You should concatenate the two strings exactly (without introducing any additional characters).

2. We left off the space last time. Create a second console.log() statement in which you concatenate the strings 
	 'Hello' and 'World', but this time make sure to also include apce(' ') between the two words.

console.log('Hello' + 'World');
console.log('Hello ' + 'World');
