'''
Matplotlib is a Python library used to create charts and graphs. 

In this first lesson, you will get an overview of the basic commands necessary
to build and label a line graph.
The concepts you will learn include:

- Creating a line graph from data

- Changing the appearance of the line

- Zooming in on different parts of the axis

- Putting labels on titles and axes

- Creating a more complex figure layout

- Adding legends to graphs

- Changing tick labels and positions

- Saving what you've made

By the end of the lesson, you'll be well on your way to becomeing a master at
presenting and organizing your data in Python.

To the right, you can see an example of the kind of chart you'll be able to 
make by the end of this lesson!
