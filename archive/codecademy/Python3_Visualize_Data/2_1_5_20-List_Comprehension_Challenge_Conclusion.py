# 2. Python for Data Analysis
# 1. Python Lists
# 5. List Comprehension - Code Challenge
# 20. List Comprehension Challenge Conclusion

''' 
You practiced list comprehension syntax like:

temperatures = [-5, 29, 26, -7, 1, 18, 12, 31]
temperatures_adjusted = [temp + 20 for temp in temperaturs]

and basic zip syntax like:

zip([1,2,3], [4,5,6])

Also, along the way you practiced these core Python concepts:

- Strings and substrings
- Getting characters from an index
- Boolean operators and comparators
- Mathematical operations
- String concatenation
- Casting from an integer to a string (obsolete with f''?)

Great job!

# Ok this was basic, but list comprehension have been something I wish I did more
# of during the python courses. This was great! Wish there was more like this, 
# where we basically just go in and grind variants of a function/concept/etc.
