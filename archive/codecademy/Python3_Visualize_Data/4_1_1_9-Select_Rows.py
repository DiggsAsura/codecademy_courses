Let's revisit our orders from ShoeFly.com:

id 	first_name	last_name	email	shoe_type	shoe_material	shoe_color
54791	Rebecca	Lindsay	RebeccaLindsay57@hotmail.com	clogs	faux-leather	black
53450	Emily	James	EmilyJames25@gmail.com	ballet flats	faux-leather	navy
91987	Joyce	Waller	Joyce.Waller@gmail.com	sandals	fabric	black
14437	Justin	Erickson	Justin.Erickson@outlook.com	clogs	faux-leather	red
â€¦	

Maybe our Customer Service department has just received a message from Joyce Waller, so
we want to know exactly what she ordered. We want to select this single row of data.

DataFrames are zero-indexed, meaning that we start with the 0th row and count up from 
there. Joyce Waller's order is the 2nd row.

We select it using the following command:


orders.iloc[2]


When we select a single row, the result is a Series (just like when we selct a single
column).
