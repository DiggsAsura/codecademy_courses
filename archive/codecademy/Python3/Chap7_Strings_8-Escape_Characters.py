# Chap 7 - Strings
# 8. Escape Characters

# Ok getting introduced to how to fix strings that want to use certain characters which have other meaning in 
# python. Fx. fav_fruite = "He said, "blueberries are my favorite!""
# This will break the syntax. Need to use the "escape character" \ 
# Fx. fav_fruite = "He said, \"blueberries are my favorite!\""

# Try to remember!

# 1. Fix the password

#password = "theycallme"crazy"91"
password = "theycallme\"crazy\"91"

print(password)
