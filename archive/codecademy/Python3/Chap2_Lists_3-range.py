# Your code below:

# Task 1 - predefined text, make it count to 8 (default value 3)
number_list = range(9)
print(list(number_list))

# Task 2 - make range from 0 - 7 and print it. 
zero_to_seven = range(8)
print(list(zero_to_seven))

# However, can i also write it like this?
print(list(range(8)))
# boom, yes!
