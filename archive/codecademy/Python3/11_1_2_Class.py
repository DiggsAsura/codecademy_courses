# Class
# 
# A class is a template for a data type. It describes the kind of information that
# class will and how a programmer will interact with that data. Define a class using
# the class keyword. PEP 8 Style Guide for Python Code 
# (https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#class-names) recommends capitalizing the
# names of classes to make them easier to identify.
class CoolClass:
	pass
# 
# In the above example we created a class and named it CoolClass. We used the
# pass keyword in Python to indicate that the body of the class was intentionally 
# left blank so we don't cause an IndentationError. We'll learn about all the 
# things we can put in the body of a class in the next few exercises.

# Tasks
# 1. Define an empty class called Facede. We'll chip away at it soon!

class Facade:
	pass
