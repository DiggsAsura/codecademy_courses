# Ok so this course is going over pipenv and different
# enviroments. 

# This makes me make a couple directories. Not sure if
# I will upload all of this to github, but lets see 
# how the rest unfolds

# Basically showing how to install isolated enviroemnts
# with pipenv --three
# pipenv install numpy==1.15.2 (version number)
# so that it's easier to make and maintain projects
# with different dependencies. 

# - pipenv shell
# - import numpy
# - print(numpy.__version__)
# 
# just a couple reminders.
