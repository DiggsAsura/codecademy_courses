# Chapter 11 - Classes
# 1. Introduction to Classes
# 3. Instantiation

# Instantiation
#
# A class doesn't accomplish anything simply by being defined. A class must be 
# instantiated. In other words, we must create an instance of the class, in order
# to breathe life into the schematic. 
#
# Instantiating a class looks a lot like calling a function. We would be able to 
# create an instance of our defined CoolClass as follows: 
# cool_instance = CoolClass()
#
# Above, we created an object by adding parentheses to the name of the class. We then
# assign that new instance to the variable cool_instance for safe-keeping so we can
# access our instance of CoolClass at a later time. 

# Tasks
# 1. In script.py we see our Facade class from last exercise. Make a Faceade 
# 	 instance and save it to the variable facade_1

class Facade:
	pass
	
facade_1 = Facade()
