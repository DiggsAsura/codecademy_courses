def introduction(first_name, last_name):
	return last_name + ", " + first_name + " " + last_name
	

# Uncomment these function calls to test your introduction function:
print(introduction("James", "Bond"))
# should print Bond, James Bond
print(introduction("Maya", "Angelou"))
# should print Angelou, Maya Angelou

# Major aha when it comes to cocatenate strings. NEEDS to be +, the comma , won't do if you want a readable output!!
