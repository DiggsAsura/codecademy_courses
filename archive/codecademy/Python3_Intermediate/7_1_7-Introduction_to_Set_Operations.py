# 7. Specialized Collections
# 1. Sets
# 7. Introduction to Set Operations

# A lot of the usefulness of a set container comes from the set operations.
# These allow you to combine sets, find the difference and intersections of 
# sets, and more! You can combine these operations to perform complex logic
# problems on multiple sets. This can be useful for filtering items, 
# categorizing, combining, as well as many other uses.
#
# The operations we will be looking at are:
#
#   - Unions
#
#   - Intersections (and Intersection Updates)
#
#   - Differences (and Difference Updates)
#
#   - Symmetric Differences (and Symmetric Difference Updates)
#
# Additional operations will not be covered in this lesson, such as 
# finding subsets and supersets. Information about these operations can be
# found in the Python documentation:
# https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#set
#
# Look over the venn Diagrams for different set operations using a set A
# and a set B. We will be covering all four in the next exercises!
