# Object Oriented programming is a programming paradigm
# Others are Procedural, and Functional

# Data and Behavior
# Data: Task Description
# Data: Task is Complete
# Behavior: Toggle Task Complete/Incomplete

# OOP handles data
# data and behavoir is grouped together in objects. 


# OOP four pillars
# Encapsulations
# Abstraction
# Inheritance
# Polymorphism

# Encapsulation
# Bundle data and behavior together into its own entity

# Abstraction
# Hide complex logic, makes it understandable (send e-mail, dont know 
# all the nitty gritty)

# Inheritance
# Allows a class to inherit all the functionality of another class 
# Enables us to reuse alot of stuff!

# Polymorphism
# Having multiple forms. 
# Obj1 = Task Type
# Obj2 = DeadlineTask Type
# Obj2 is also a Task type
# Can be both types and can be used as such
