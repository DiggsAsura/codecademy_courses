Congratulations on writing your first Flask app with database support!

In this lesson, you have learned how to:

- import Flask-SQLAlchemy and configure your app to support database connections.

- create your first model representing a table schema using Flask-SQLAlchemy ORM
  declaring classes that extend Model

- specify attributes of database entities by using Column fields

- set the primary key Column

- create a one-to-many relationship by using relationship()

- specify forign key columns

- initialize the database according to the declared models by using create_all()

- create database entries as instances of the declared Flask-SQLAlchemy classes

We added the Annotation model to the app.py file in order to complete our 
database schema shown in the first exercise of this lesson. Moreover, we demonstrate
for you in the browser how to combine the templates and database queries to list
all the books we already put in the database for you. In the next lesson, you will
learn how to accomplish this yourself! Excited? Let's go.

# Not super excited tbh lool. Constant overload! But let's go indeed. At
# some point, maybe all this jazz is just clicking together!
