/*
Sometimes we want to combine multiple conditions in a WHERE clause to make the
result set more specific and useful.

One way of doing this is to use the AND operator. here, we use the AND operator
to only return 90's romance movies. 

SELECT *
FROM movies
WHERE year BETWEEN 1990 AND 1999 AND genre = 'romance';

- year BETWEEN 1990 AND 1999 is the 1st condition

- genre = 'romance' is the 2nd condition

- AND combines the two conditions

With AND, both conditions must be true for the row to be included in the
result.

SELECT *

WHERE year BETWEEN 1970 AND 1979 AND imdb_rating > 8;

SELECT *
FROM movies
WHERE genre IS 'horror' AND year < 1985;
