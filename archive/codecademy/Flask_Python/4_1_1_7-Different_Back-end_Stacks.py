Unlike the front-end, which must be built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, 
there’s a lot of flexibility in which technologies can be used in order to 
create the back-end of a web application. Developers can construct back-ends 
in many different languages like PHP, Java, JavaScript, Python, and more.

You don’t need to reinvent the wheel to create a robust back-end. Instead, most 
developers make use of frameworks which are collections of tools that shape the 
organization of your back-end and provide efficient ways of accomplishing 
otherwise difficult tasks.

There are numerous back-end frameworks from which developers can choose. Here 
are a few examples:

Laravel (PHP)
Express.js (JavaScript/Node)
Ruby on Rails (Ruby)
Spring (Java)
JSF (Java)
Flask (Python)
Django (Python)
ASP.NET (C#)

The collection of technologies used to create the front-end and back-end of a 
web application is referred to as a stack. This is where the term full-stack 
developer comes from; rather than working in either the front-end or the 
back-end exclusively, a full-stack developer works in both.

For example, the MEAN stack is a technology stack for building web applications 
that uses MongoDB, Express.js, AngularJS, and Node.js: MongoDB is used as the 
database, Node.js with Express.js for the rest of the back-end, and Angular 
is used as a front-end framework. While the LAMP Stack, sometimes considered 
the archetypal stack, uses Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP.
