# fun date!
# 22022022 :D

# Ok just here to upload SOMETHING to github, to keep my streak. 
# I'm not on the lazy side, I just take a, Git+GitHub course over
# at codecademy, so have been focusing that today. 
#
# Up until now, I have pretty much just used github as a dropbox, 
# but it starts to become many files, and i wanna rename etc.. gotta
# set it all up!
