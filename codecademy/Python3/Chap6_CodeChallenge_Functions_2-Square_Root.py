# Chapter 6 - Python Code Challenges
# Functions 2
# Square Root

# Another useful function for solving math problems is the square root function. We can create this
# using similar steps from the last problem. The code will look very similar. We need to:

# 1. Set up the function header for square_root which accepts one parameter
# 2. Take the square root of the input value
# 3. Return the result

# Just as easy, if i just rememberd how to calculate square root in python. Google! Thats allowed right! :D

def square_root(num):
	#return sqrt(num) # This is not what the task asks, but def something I rather use :D 
	return num ** 0.5
	
# Uncomment these function calls to test your square_root function:
print(square_root(16))
# should print 4
print(square_root(100))
# should print 10


# Apparently I have done these code challenges before. Idk why I got them again.
