# Chap 7.2 - Strings
# String Methods
# 2. Formatting Methods

# Seems like an easy entrance, which I like haha. God that linear regression off platform task is spooking me still. 
# Like wtf was that. 

# Going through three basic ones in the intro text. .upper() .lower() .title(), these are super handy.

# 1. Make poem_title have title case and save it to poem_title_fixed
# 2. Print poem_title and poem_title_fixed
# 3. Make poen_author uppercase and save it to poem_author_fixed
# 4. Print poem_author and poem_author_fixed

poem_title = "spring storm"
poem_author = "William Carlos Williams"

poem_title_fixed = poem_title.title()
print(poem_title)
print(poem_title_fixed)

poem_author_fixed = poem_author.upper()
print(poem_author)
print(poem_author_fixed)
