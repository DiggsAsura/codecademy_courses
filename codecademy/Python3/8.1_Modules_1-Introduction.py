# Chap 8.1 - Modules
# Modules in Python
# 1. Introduction

# In this lesson, weâ€™ll explore how to use tools other people have built in Python that are 
# not included automatically for you when you install Python. Python allows us to package code into 
# files or sets of files called modules. 
#
# A module is a collection of Python declarations intended broadly to be used as a tool. Modules are often
# referred to as "libraries" or "packages" - a package is really a directory that holds a collection 
# of modules. 
#
# Usually, to use a module in a file, the basic syntax you need at the top of that file is
#
# from module_name import object_name
#
# Often, a library will include a lot of code that you don't need that may slow down your program or conflict
# with existing code. Because of this, it makes sense only to import what you need.
# 
# One common library that comes as part of the Python Standard Library is datetime. datetime helps you work
# with dates and times in Python.
#
# Let's get started by importing and using the datetime module. In this case, you'll notice that datetime is both
# the name of the library and the name of the object that you are importing

# Task:
# 1. In script.py, import the datetime type from the datetime library
# 2. Create a variable current_time and set it equal to datetime.no()
# 3. Print out current_time.

from datetime import datetime

current_time = datetime.now()
print(current_time)
