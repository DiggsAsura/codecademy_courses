# Starting the Flask path 
 
19th April 2022: Okies, time to pick up here after a week off. Did the 
HTML and CSS courses first, as part of them was recommended to do beforehand. 
That was a nice catchup, 18 years since last time touched HTML. Let's go.
 
12th April 2022. Starting the Flask path immediatly after finishing off the Intermediate Python 3
Course over at Codecademy. Was (and kinda is) torn between this and Advanced Python 3, but I'll go for this for now. I might pivot and start up Advnaced first - lets see how goes. 
 

Note: 
Since I already completed the basic Python 3 course, 45% of this path was already registered as
completed 
 
Cheers, Diggs
