You’ve probably heard that data is a big deal. By some measures, 90% of the 
world’s data has been generated in just the past two years! From a stored 
credit card number on an e-commerce site to the timestamp when you hit pause 
on Netflix, modern web applications collect a lot of data. For that data to be 
useful, it has to be organized and stored somewhere.

The back-ends of modern web applications include some sort of database, often 
more than one. Databases are collections of information. There are many 
different databases, but we can divide them into two types: relational databases 
and non-relational databases (also known as NoSQL databases). Whereas relational 
databases store information in tables with columns and rows, non-relational 
databases might use other systems such as key-value pairs or a document storage 
model. SQL, Structured Query Language, is a programming language for accessing 
and changing data stored in relational databases. Popular relational databases 
include MySQL and PostgreSQL while popular NoSQL databases include MongoDB and 
Redis.

In addition to the database itself, the back-end needs a way to programmatically 
access, change, and analyze the data stored there.
