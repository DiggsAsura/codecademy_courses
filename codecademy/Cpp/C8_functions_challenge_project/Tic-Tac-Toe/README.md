# Tic Tac Toe

Sept 23 2022. 

First project in Codecademy C++ which was very open ended. It's taking me some
days to let this grow in the back of my head, while actually been very busy
with work, school, family, band and yea - it's been working silently in the greyhairs. 

At first, there was definetly a very overwhelming feel. The task is very very 
slim on hints. I do know I should know enough for this by now, so would not just
run off and google it. But I have never done something like this so it did not
come to me easily. 

Every other day I had a little bit of progress on how to do it. 
At first I was thinking about making vectors with every possible solutions of
the board. Thats.... not.... it. 
But - the other way around kinda! 

I think I'm quite close, even though it has been slow. And it feels more 
rewarding for sure.
