### Literally just a short intro
# Introduction to Conditionals & Logic

Every program we've seen so far has only had one possible path of execution - they 
all execute line by line, from top to bottom. And every time you run out of those
programs, it gives you the same exact result. But it's the twenty-first century, and we like options!

In this lesson, we will explore how programs make decisions by evaluating conditions
and intorudce logic into our code!

We'll be covering the following concepts:

*if, else if and else statements
*switch statements
*relational operators
*logical operators

So... if you've already learned these concepts in another language, go to thenext lesson -
else, prepare yourself and let's get started!
