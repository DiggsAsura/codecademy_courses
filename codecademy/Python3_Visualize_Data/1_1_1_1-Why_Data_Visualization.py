Welcome to Data Visualization with Python!

Each day, individuals across the globe collect terabytes of digital data for different
purposes. These data vary in topics and size - to a marketer, data might mean metrics
on how users interact with an online platform; to an astrophysicist, data might 
represent the numeric luminosity of different bodies in the universe.

Although the data vary in nature, we can think of data in their raw form as resources
that lead to new understandings. However, raw data holds as much potential as they 
hold noise.

Data visualization is the process of mapping, graphing, plotting, and charting data
to discover relationships and patterns.

We will be coding data visualizations with Python, and increasingly popular programming
language in the field of data science. The goal of this path is to teach you how to see
the meaning of dataset and convey that information to others.

Instructions
By the end of this path, you will be able to create the data visualizations you see on
the right. 

Capstone Option 1 includes visualizing a Netflix Stock Profile and Captopne Option 2
focuses on GDP and Life Expectancy in 5 countries.

Spend some time reading each capstone's graphs. What insights reveal themselves in
the visualizations?
