'''
In helping MatplotSip visualize their data, you've learned a bunch of new plot
types that you can use in Matplotlib. Congratulations on adding these new
plotting abilities to your reportoire:

- How to compare categories of data with bar graphs

- Add error bars to graphs

- Use fill_between to display shaded error on line graphs

- Create stacked bar graphs for easier comparisons

- Create side-by-side bar graphs

- Create and format pie charts to compare proportional datasets

- Analyze frequency data using histograms, including multiple
  histograms on the same plot

- Normalize histograms

In the upcoming project, you will experiment with these different plot types 
and how to best use them to find patterns or trends in a new data set.
