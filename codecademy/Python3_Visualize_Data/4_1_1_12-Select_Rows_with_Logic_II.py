'''
You can also combine multiple logical statements, as long as each statement is in 
parantheses.

For instance, suppose we wanted to select all rows where the customer's age was under
30 or the customer's name was 'Martha Jones':

name	address	phone	age
Martha Jones	123 Main St.	234-567-8910	28
Rose Tyler	456 Maple Ave.	212-867-5309	22
Donna Noble	789 Broadway	949-123-4567	35
Amy Pond	98 West End Ave.	646-555-1234	29
Clara Oswald	54 Columbus Ave.	714-225-1957	31
â€¦


We could use the following code:

df[(df.age < 30) | (df.name == 'Martha Jones')]


In Python | means or and & means and.

import pandas as pd

df = pd.DataFrame([
  ['January', 100, 100, 23, 100],
  ['February', 51, 45, 145, 45],
  ['March', 81, 96, 65, 96],
  ['April', 80, 80, 54, 180],
  ['May', 51, 54, 54, 154],
  ['June', 112, 109, 79, 129]],
  columns=['month', 'clinic_east',
           'clinic_north', 'clinic_south',
           'clinic_west'])


march_april = df[(df.month == 'March') | (df.month == 'April')]
print(march_april)
