excuse me for not getting anything uploaded today, and now just go push nothing for keeping my streak up!

I AM THERE mentally, but been on some tasks and quizes, and very pushed in RL for a couple of days now. I will be back tomorrow. But could not all my months of progress here on github go to waste by not uploading one single day. goal is upload every day in a year. even if some days have to be like this, with uploading nothing.

cheers, diggs
