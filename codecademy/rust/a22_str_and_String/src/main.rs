/*
 * &str and String
 * ================
 *
 * Managing strings of characters such as "this short sentence." is a common task handled by most
 * languages. Rust gives us flexibility for the best performance possible by providing us with two
 * different string types: &str and String.
 *
 * The important difference between these types is that &str is an immutable reference to data in
 * memory, while String is a collection that allows composition and mutation. 
 *
 *
 * &str
 * -----
 *
 * A &str is an immutable slice of bytes of a fixed size, and is often referred to as a "string
 * slice". Since a &str is only a reference to data, our type declarations will always have the
 * preceding &. 
 *
 * The data of a &str is stored on the stack which makes them computationally efficient. 
 *
 */

fn ex1() {
    let immutable ="I am a location in memory";

    // A type annotated str. 
    let value: &str = ", and cannot be mutated.";

    // A type annotated str with an explicit lifetime.
    let baked: &'static str = "I am baked into the binary!";

    println!("{immutable} {value}");
    println!("{baked}");
}

/* Since a &str is immutable, we cannot do much with them other than validate them and acces their
 * data. Whenever we do not know the size of our string or plan on manipulating the value, we
 * should utilize the String type. 
 */


/*
 * String
 * -------
 *
 * A String is stored on the heap which allows us to mutate the value at will. While heap memory is
 * never as fast as the stack, the heap allows Rust to automatically resize the allocated memory
 * when needed during runtime. 
 */

fn ex2() {
    let empty_string = String::new();
    let value_string = String::from("Cyan");

    let mut mutable_string = String::from("Indigo");
    mutable_string.push_str(" and Maroon.");

    println!("{mutable_string}");
}


/* 
 * If we look at the source code for the std library, we can see that a String is actually a
 * Vec<u8>. This allows us to utilize iterators and other methods accessible on Vec<T>.
 *
 * Strings are very ergonomic in terms of how we can compose them. Concatenation can be
 * accomplished the following ways. 
 */

fn ex3() {
    let a = "Welcome";
    let b = " to";
    let c = " the";
    let d = " show!";

    let welcome1 = format!("{a}{b}{c}{d}!");
    let welcome2 = [a, b, c, d, "!"].concat();
    let mut welcome3 = a.to_string() + b + c + d + "!";

    // We can even append to a mutable String with the += operator.
    let mut welcome4 = welcome3;
    welcome4 += " Lets have som fun!";

    println!("{welcome4}");
}

/* Dynamically sized data types such as String do not implement the Copy trait because its data is
 * stored on the heap. This means we cannot derive Copy on structs which have Strings as fields.
 *
 * In these circumstances, we should utilize Clone to duplicate our data when needed. 
 */


/*
 * Conversion
 * -------------
 *
 * &str to String
 *
 * We can turn a &str into a String using the String::from() or to_string() method. Both are
 * commonly utilized in Rust and using one over the other is a matter of personal preference. 
 */

fn ex4() {
    let pineapple = "pineapple";

    let new_string = String::from(pineapple);
    let new_string = pineapple.to_string();
}

/* String to &str
 *
 * To utilize a String as a &str, we only have to reference the value.
 */

fn ex5() {
    fn say_fruit(name: &str) {
        println!("{name}")
    }

    let papaya = String::from("Papaya");

    say_fruit(&papaya);
}



/*
 * UTF-8
 * ------
 *
 * Rust's strings utilize UTF-8 encoding. This is a global standard that allows representations of
 * most all written languages and many symbols, includeing emojis. 
 */

fn ex6() {
    let latin = "corderoy";
    let greek =  "œÑŒØœÄŒøœÑŒ± œáœéœÅŒø";
    let maths = "‚Ñá ‚Ñé ‚ãâ ‚äª ‚äΩ ‚àû ‚ãä";
    let suits = "‚ô† ‚ô• ‚ô¶ ‚ô£";
    let emojis = "üòëüòëüòÄ";

/* UTF-8 is a dynamically sized encoding scheme. This means that some single width characters are
 * actually multiple byes combined to form a single symbol. 
 */
    
    // These take up the same amount of memory.
    let wow1 = "wow";
    let wow2 = "‚òΩ";

    println!("{} == {}", wow1.len(), wow2.len());
}


/* 
 * Other Strings
 * --------------
 *
 * Most current operating systems do not encode strings in UTF-8 and instead utilize their own
 * standards of encoding. Rust provides us the OsStr and OsString types to safely interact with
 * these systems.
 *
 * For interacting with "null-terminating" strings or the C programming language, Rust provides us
 * the CStr and CString types. If you're not familiar with C, try our Learn C course. 
 *
 * These types are designed so that there is little to no performance penalty when converting
 * between them and their respective &str and String types.
