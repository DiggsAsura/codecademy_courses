# Introduction to Logical Operators

Often, when we are trying to create a control flow for our program, we'll
encounter situations where the logic cannot be satisfied with a single condition.

Logical operators are used to combine two or more conditions. They allow programs to make more flexible decisions.
The result of the opertaion of a logical operator is a bool value of either true or false. 

There are three logical operators that we will cover: 

- &&: the and logical operator
- ||: the or logical operator
- !: the not logical operator

We will also discuss the order of operations. 

Let's get started!
