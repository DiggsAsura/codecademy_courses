# Codecademy Learn Intermediate Python 3

*March 4 2022*

Welcome. I'm currently learning Python. After finishing off the 
Learn Python 3 course over at Codecademy, I jump over to the Intermediate
Python course. Unsure if I'm really ready, but I'll give it a go :)

I will continue in the same manner. Try to do a couple tasks every day.
However, I will try to keep the naming convention of files in this repo
less messy then the previous repo, where I changed it a multitude of times
during the lessons. 

Cheers
K
