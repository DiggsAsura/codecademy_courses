# 1. Introduction to Python Sets

# In Python, a set is a group of elements that are unordered and do not contain
# duplicates. Although it may seem that the usefulness of this data structure is
# limited, it can actually b very helpful for organizing items and performing
# mathematics.
#
# For example, we can imagine two different groups of items that have some 
# similarities and differences. Using set mathematics, we can find the matching
# itmes, differences, combine the sets based on different parameters, and more!
# This is especially helpful when combing very large datasets.
#
# Alternatively, there is also a immutable version of a set called frozenset.
# A frozenset behaves similarly to a normal set, but it does not include 
# methods that modify the forzenset in any way.
#
# In this lesson, well explore:
#
# - How to create a set and a frozenset.
#
# - How to add a set (we won't be able to mutate a frozenset).
#
# - How to remove from a set (we won't be able to mutate a frozenset).
#
# - How to find specific elements in a set and a frozenset.
#
# - How to perform set operations such as unions, intersections, and more
#
# Let's jump in!
#
# Examine the sample set visual. Notice that new elements have no trouble 
# getting into a set, but existing elements cannot be added!


#{'P', 0, True, 3.8, 'N'}

# No idea how to write this visual down.
