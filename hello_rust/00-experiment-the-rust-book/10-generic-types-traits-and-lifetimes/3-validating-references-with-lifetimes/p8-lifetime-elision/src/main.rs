// Lifetime Elision
// =================
//
// You've learend that every reference has a lifetime and that you need to specify lifetime
// parameters for functions or structs that use references. However, in Chapter 10 we had a
// function in Listing 4-9, shown again in Listing 10-25, that compild without lifetime
// annotations.

fn first_word(s: &str) -> &str {
    let bytes = s.as_bytes();

    for (i, &item) in bytes.iter().enumerate() {
        if item == b' ' {
            return &s[0..i];
        }
    }

    &s[..]
}
// 10-25: A function we defined in Listing 4-9 that compiled without lifetime annotations, even
// though the parameter and return type are references

// The reason this function compiles without lifetime annotations is historical: in early versions
// (pre-1.0) of Rust, this code wouldn't have compiled because every reference needed an explicit
// lifetime. At that time, the function signature would have been written like this:

fn first_word<'a>(s: &'a str) -> &'a str {}

// After writing a lot of Rust code, the Rust team found that Rust programmers were entering the
// same lifetime annotations over and over in particular situations. These situations were
// predictable and followed a few deterministic patterns. The developers programmed these patterns
// into the compiler's code so that the borrow checker could infer the lifetimes in these
// situations and wouldn't need explicit annotations.
//
// The piece of Rust history is relevant because it's possible that more deterministic pattern will
// emerge and be added to the compiler. In the future, even fewer lifetime annotations might be
// required.
//
// The patterns programmed into Rust's analysis of references are called the lifetime elision
// rules. These aren't rules for programmers to follow; they're a set of particular cases that the
// compiler will consider, and if your code fits these cases, you don't need to write the lifetimes
// explicitly.
//
// The elision rules don't provide full inference. If Rust deterministically applies the rules but
// there is still ambiguity as to what lifetimes the references have, the compiler won't guess what
// the lifetime of the remaining references should be. Instead of guessing, the compiler will giev
// you an error that you can resolve by adding the lifetime annotations.
//
// Lifetimes on functions or method parameters are called input lifetimes, and lifetimes on return
// values are called output lifetimes.
//
// The compiler uses three rules to figure out the lifetimes of the references when there aren't
// explicit annotations. The first rule applies to input lifetimes, and the second and third rules
// apply to output lifetimes. If the compiler gets to the end of the three rules and three are
// still references for which it can't figure out lifetimes, the compiler will stop with an error.
// These rules apply to fn definitions as well as impl blocks.
//
// The first rule is that the compiler assigns a different lifetime parameter to each lifetime in
// each input type. References like &'_ i32 needs a lifetime parameter, and structures like
// ImportantExcerpt<'_> need a lifetime parameter. For example:
//
// - The function fn(x: &i32) would get one lifetime parameter and become fn foo<'a>(x: &'a i32).
// - The function foo(x: &i32, y: &i32) would get two lifetime parameters and become fn foo<'a,
// 'b>(x: &'a i32, y: &'b i32).
// - The function fn foo(x: &ImportantExcerpt) would get two lifetime parameters and become fn
// foo<'a, 'b>(&'a ImportantExcerpt<'b>).
//
// The second rule is that, if there is exactly one input lifetime parameter, that lifetime is
// assigned to all output lifetime parameters: fn foo<'a>(x: &'a i32) -> &'a i32.
//
// The third rule is that, if there are multiple input lifetime parameters, but one of them is
// &self or &mut self because this is a method, the lifetime of self is assigned to all output
// lifetime parameters. This third rule makes methods much nicer to read and write because fewer
// symbols are necessary.
//
// Let's pretend we're the compiler. We'll apply these rules to figure out the lifetimes of the
// references in the signature of the first_word function in Listing 10-25. The signature starts
// without any lifetimes associated with the references:
//
fn first_word(s: &str) -> &str {
    // --snip--
}
// Then the compiler applies the first rule, which specifies that each parameter gets its own
// lifetime. We'll call it 'a as usual, so now the signature is this:
fn first_word<'a>(s: &'a str) -> &strÂ {}

// The second rule applies because there is exactly one input lifetime. The second rule specifies
// that the lifetime of the one input parameter gets assigned to the output lifetime, so the
// signature is now this:
fn first_word<'a>(s: &'a str) -> &'a str {}

// Now all the references in this function signature have lifetimes, and the compiler can continue
// its analysis without needing the programmer to annotate the lifetimes in this function
// signature.
//
// Let's look at another example, this time using the longest function that had no lifetime
// parameters when we started working with it in Listing 10-20:
fn longest(x: &str, y: &str) -> &str {}

// Let's apply the first rule: each parameter gets its own lifetime. This time we have two
// parameters instead of one, so we have two lifetimes:
fn longest<'a, 'b>(x: &'a str, y: &'b str) -> &str{}

// You can see that the second rule doesn't apply because there is more than one input lifetime.
// The third rule doesn't apply either, because longest is a function rather than a method, so none
// of the parameters are self. After working whtourh all three rules, we still haven't figured out
// what the return type's lifetime is. This is why we got an error trying to compile the code in
// Listing 10-20: the compiler worked through the lifetime elision rules but still couldn't figure
// out all the lifetimes of the references in the signature.
//
// Because the third rule relaly only applies in method signatures, we'll look at lifetimes in that
// context next to see why the third rule means we don't have to annotate lifetimes in method
// signtures very often.
