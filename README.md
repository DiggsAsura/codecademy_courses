# Study

My repos ended up a big mess with different online courses like several codecademy courses, privatly digging into rust, Fagskolen etc.
Trying to restructure my github. I'll do all study related in here, which to be frank, is not
interesting for anyone but myself to move files between computers, haha.

Oh well. Cheers!

Moved a ton of old folders into "archive" folders, to try keep the folders more on top of what I currently work on.
