# Codecademy courses

Ok so the point of this repo is not to spam out CC's content. I just try to 
clean up my own repos a bit. I do and have been studying quite a bit over there
for the last year and my main page here on GitHub getting quiiiite messy. 

I put all the CC stuff in here. The dates gonna all be messed up though, idk
if it matters, but I might as well try to get a list with dates for when 
each course have been done. Maybe. Or not xD

Anyways, cheers
Kenneth
