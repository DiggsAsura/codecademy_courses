# Codecademy courses

Ok so the point of this repo is not to spam out CC's content. I just try to 
clean up my own repos a bit. I do and have been studying quite a bit over there
for the last year and my main page here on GitHub getting quiiiite messy. 

I put all the CC stuff in here. The dates gonna all be messed up though, idk
if it matters, but I might as well try to get a list with dates for when 
each course have been done. Maybe. Or not xD

EDIT: Holy fuckballs
SO while I thought it sounded like a good idea to remove the repos, after moved in here
it turns out it deleted my history back in time. That hurts! I will not delete other
repos though... This might sound stupid, but I went for a code every day streak, and been going
strong since january 12, so this sucks major balls being in mid september and lost a week or two with 
acitivy, when in reality that all is just moved here. 

OH well, rant over look forward.

Anyways, cheers
Kenneth
