# Summary

Closures and iterators are Rust features inspired by functional programming language ideas. They
contribute to Rust's capability to clearly express high-level ideas at low-level performance. The
implementation of closures and iterators are such that runtime performance is not affected. This is
part of Rust's goal to strive to provide zero-cost abstractions.

Now that we've improved the expressiveness of our I/O project, let's look at some more features of
cargo that will help us share the project with the world.
