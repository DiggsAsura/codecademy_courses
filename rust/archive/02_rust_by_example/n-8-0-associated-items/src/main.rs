/* Associated items
 * =================
 *
 * "Associated Items" refers to a set of rules pertainint to itmes of various types. It is an
 * extension to trait generics, and allows traits to internally define new items. 
 *
 * One such item is called an associated type, providing simpler usage patterns when the trait is
 * generic over its container type. */
