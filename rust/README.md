Learning rust! The journey starts May 24. 2022

### Update 15.08.2022
Yea summer is gone, and it was hectic AF RL this year. New appartment, renovating two places,
renting out new apartment, going vacation etc. Yea.. I know I know this is just making excuses
but now I'll eventually get back at it. 

### Update 20.06.2022
Ok so progress here is kinda slow. The first two weeks, I started in the totally wrong end
and could not progress/grasp anything, quite literally.

After a couple of weeks I found some other resources, and things starts to loosen up. A bit.
At least I can understand some of it by reading, but it's still freaking hard to actually
make something as simple as a calculator. 

RL have been very rough last week and still going on. Both my GF and myself going through 
some wired shit so will be slower then usual here now. Will eventually pick back up. Just 
uploading something, if its source, or a rant here somewhere every day to at least
show I keep it in my back of my head all the time.

Cheers


### Update
Uh, think I'm going to skip the whole Day# structure here. It's just going to be a mess when some tasks going over several days.
