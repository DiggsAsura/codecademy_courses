# The Rust Programming Language - Experiement

https://rust-book.cs.brown.edu/experiment-intro.html

Started this after finishing up Rust by Example. This language is sooo hard to learn as a noob to 
programming. With this experimantal version of the Rust book, they aim to more efficient take in the content by adding quizzies etc while we go. 

Fingers crossed! I really beleive in Rust, it's just so damn hard to get into.
