# Summary

Sharing code with Cargo and crates.io is part of what makes the Rust ecosystem useful for many
different tasks. Rust's standard library is small and stable, but carates are easy to share, use and
improve on a timeline different from that of the language. Don't be shy about sharing code that's
useful to you on crates.io; it's likely that it will be useful to someone else as well!
