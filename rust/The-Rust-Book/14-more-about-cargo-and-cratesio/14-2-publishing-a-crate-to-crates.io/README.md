# Publishing a Crate to Crates.io

We've used packages from crates.io as dependencies of our project, but you can also share your
code with other people by publishing your own packages. The crate registry at crates.io distributes
the source code of your packages, so it primarily hosts code that is open source.

Rust and Cargo have features that make your published package easier for people to find and use.
We'll talk about some of these features next and then explain how to publish a package.
